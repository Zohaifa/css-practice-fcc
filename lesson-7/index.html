        In the world of combat sports and martial arts, fighting can generally be broken down into three main components: <br>
        1. <a href="striking.html">striking</a> <br>
        2. <a href="grappling.html">grappling</a>, and <br>
        3. <a href="wrestling.html">wrestling</a>. <br>
        Each of these elements plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of a fight, and martial artists often specialize in one or more of them to create a well-rounded skill set.
        Striking focuses on delivering powerful and precise blows from a distance, grappling involves controlling and submitting an opponent through holds and locks, while wrestling revolves around positioning and dominating the opponent through takedowns and control. 
        Whether in a traditional martial art or in mixed martial arts (MMA), mastering these three aspects allows a fighter to adapt to different situations, creating a balanced and versatile approach to combat.
