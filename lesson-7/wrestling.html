        Wrestling is a dynamic and physically demanding combat sport focused on taking an opponent down to the mat, controlling their movements, and achieving dominant positions. 
        It incorporates a range of techniques including takedowns, throws, clinch work, and pins to limit the opponentâ€™s ability to escape or fight back. 
        Wrestlers use a blend of explosive power, speed, and technique to outmaneuver their opponents, often aiming to tire them out or score points through control and successful takedowns. 
        Wrestling is a foundational discipline in mixed martial arts (MMA) because of its emphasis on positional dominance, takedown defense, and the ability to dictate the flow of the fight.
