        Striking in martial arts focuses on the art of delivering powerful and precise blows using fists, elbows, knees, and feet.
        Itâ€™s a skill that demands a combination of speed, timing, and technique.
        Martial artists who specialize in striking typically train to master techniques like jabs, crosses, hooks, uppercuts, and kicks, while also learning to defend against strikes through head movement, blocking, or evading. 
        Striking-based martial arts like boxing, Muay Thai, and kickboxing place a heavy emphasis on maintaining distance, controlling the pace of the fight, and striking effectively from both long-range and close-quarters.
