        Grappling involves techniques designed to control, submit, or overpower an opponent using body leverage, positioning, and joint manipulation. 
        This includes submissions such as armbars, chokeholds, and leg locks, as well as control positions like mount or side control. 
        Grapplers typically seek to bring the fight to the ground, where they can neutralize an opponentâ€™s striking advantage and work for a dominant position. 
        Successful grappling combines strength, technique, and the ability to anticipate an opponent's movements. 
        Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), judo, and sambo are examples of grappling disciplines, where ground control and submission play key roles.
